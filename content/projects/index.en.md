[Flute of Nyarlathotep](https://fonwiki.mooncloud.space/doku.php?id=start): wiki for the ongoing Call of Cthulhu campaign that I run for my friends over past 2+ years. Based on Masks of Nyarlathotep, but with tons of other stuff on top. Currently pretty bare, need to do a lot of writing, don't have time. The campaign is currently on hiatus (due to Russia invading).

[Roll Them Bones](https://github.com/moondownr/roll-them-bones): my Discord bot for rolling dice in Discord. Supports rules for Call of Cthulhu, Shadowrun, World of Darkness, Mutants:Year Zero, can play sound effects and delete chat messages.

[Old blog](https://blog.mooncloud.space/) with some of my longer texts about music, RPG systems and books. In Russian. Archived. Translations may be coming here later.
