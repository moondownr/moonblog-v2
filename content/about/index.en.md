Hi. My name is Alex (more or less). I'm a sysadmin, a Linux and free software user/advocate, a music nerd and a GM. I dabble in Python and translating stuff I like from English to Ukrainian and vice versa (mostly fansub).

I like Thomas Ligotti, Robert Aickman, Serhii Zhadan, Philip Dick and Scott Lynch and wish I had time to read more.

I also like Kyiv, dogs, Cowboy Bebop, pale ale, spicy food and staying awake until 5am, doing dumb stuff.
