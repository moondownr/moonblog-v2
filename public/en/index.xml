      <title>Upchk - Python script for monitoring host online/offline status</title>

      <description>I wrote a Python script that pings hosts and reports the changes in their online/offline status via email. It works on it&amp;rsquo;s own built-in times as opposed to cron and uses Python built-in smtp lib, removing dependency on postfix/sendmail. It&amp;rsquo;s also cross-platform (Linux/Windows/Mac), although I mainly tested it on Linux, because that&amp;rsquo;s what I use.
Code&amp;rsquo;s here.</description>

      <description>Absurd and romantic horror comedy, arthouse B-movie and a cult classic, starring Rupert Everett.

      <description>And on the evening of the eleventh day they came in sight of the isle of Oriab, with Ngranek rising jagged and snow-crowned in the distance. Oriab is a very great isle, and its port of Baharna a mighty city. The wharves of Baharna are of porphyry, and the city rises in great stone terraces behind them, having streets of steps that are frequently arched over by buildings and the bridges between buildings.</description>

      <description>Hi. My name is Alex (more or less). I&amp;rsquo;m a sysadmin, a Linux and free software user/advocate, a music nerd and a GM. I dabble in Python and translating stuff I like from English to Ukrainian and vice versa (mostly fansub).
I like Thomas Ligotti, Robert Aickman, Serhii Zhadan, Philip Dick and Scott Lynch and wish I had time to read more.
I also like Kyiv, dogs, Cowboy Bebop, pale ale, spicy food and staying awake until 5am, doing dumb stuff.</description>

      <description>Flute of Nyarlathotep: wiki for the ongoing Call of Cthulhu campaign that I run for my friends over past 2+ years. Based on Masks of Nyarlathotep, but with tons of other stuff on top. Currently pretty bare, need to do a lot of writing, don&amp;rsquo;t have time. The campaign is currently on hiatus (due to Russia invading).
Roll Them Bones: my Discord bot for rolling dice in Discord. Supports rules for Call of Cthulhu, Shadowrun, World of Darkness, Mutants:Year Zero, can play sound effects and delete chat messages.</description>
